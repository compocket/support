# XY Graph

In addition to time-domain and frequency domain analysis, sometimes you may need to observe the correlation between the two signal. This graph helps users to identify signal frequencies ratio, their amplitude and the phase shift of one signal relative to the other one.

{% hint style="info" %}
To open the XY window:  
    Right click on the Scope area.  
    Select **"Show XY Graph"**.

To determine the signals for x-axis and y-axis:  
    Select the signals from the spinner.

The ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2817%29.png) button reverses the selected signals. 
{% endhint %}

In the below images, you can see couple of examples that illustrates the phase difference and frequency difference effects in XY graph.

![The frequency of y-axis signal is two times the frequency of x-axis signal and 0 degree phase difference ](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2842%29.png)

![The frequency of y-axis signal is three times the frequency of x-axis signal and 0 degree phase difference ](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2827%29.png)
