# Signal Settings

There are many settings of the signals that you might change. In this page, you learn how to change all these settings for the signal. Let's begin with the context menu which will open when you right click on a signal.

**Set as Trigger Source:** This option makes the signal trigger source.  
**Trigger Option:** You can set the trigger option as auto, normal or single.  
**Trigger Type:** You can set the trigger edge as rising or falling.  
**Show FFT:** It controls the visibility of the FFT of the signal.  
**AC Coupling:** If it is selected, the software applies AC coupling on the signal.  
**Hide:** It makes the signal invisible.

In the left control plane, you can select the signal that you want to change the settings of. After selecting the signal, you can set the volt/div of the signal, change the visibility of the signal in time-domain and frequency-domain, change the coupling as DC or AC.

Additionally, you can change the color, name, unit and gain properties of the signal from the **Signals** tab that is located in the right control plane.

When you click the **edit** button \(as seen in above picture\), the dialog pops up. From there, you can change the name, the unit and the gain of the signal. Additionally, you can delete the signal, if it is a **math** signal.
