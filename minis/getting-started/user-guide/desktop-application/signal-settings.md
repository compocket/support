**Trigger Option:** You can set the trigger option as auto, normal or single.  
**Trigger Type:** You can set the trigger edge as rising or falling.  
**Show FFT:** It controls the visibility of the FFT of the signal.  
**AC Coupling:** If it is selected, the software applies AC coupling on the signal.
