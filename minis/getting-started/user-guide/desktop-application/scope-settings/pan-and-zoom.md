# Drag & Zoom

Drag & zoom are two of the very important features that the oscilloscope supports. You can drag the signals horizontally and vertically with the mouse movements. If you select the signal\(when clicked, if a signal is displayed brighter, you select it.\) the vertical movement only affects that signal. Horizontal movement affect all of them. The reason for this difference is that every signal has its own volt offset while the time offset is common.

In this page for the "zoom" part, we only talk about the rectangular zoom. Other zoom techniques are discussed in [**Time/div & Volt/div Settings**](volt-div-and-time-div-settings.md) section. 

For rectangular zoom,  you need to hold the CTRL key while dragging the mouse. The center of the rectangle is going to be the center of the zoom operation.
