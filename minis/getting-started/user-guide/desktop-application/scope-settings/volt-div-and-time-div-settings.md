# Volt/div & Time/div Settings

There are multiple ways to change the volt/div and time/div. We will go through them one by one. 

**First way:** In the left control panel, below the "Channel Settings" label, you can select the signal that you want to change the volt/div settings of. After selecting it, the volt/div value is updated according to the selected signal. Here, you can click the zoom in button to decrease the volt/div value. Likewise, you can click the zoom out button to increase the volt/div value. Other than that you can directly type your custom value for the volt/div. When you push the "Enter", the volt/div is set. If the custom value is out of bounds, the value is ignored. Same things apply for the time/div. Only difference is that this time/div is a global setting.

**Second way:** This part is a little bit tricky. In the plot area of the scope, if you scroll the mouse wheel, you change the time/div. If you scroll the mouse wheel and hold the CTRL key, you change all the signals' volt/divs at the same time. If you scroll the mouse wheel, hold the CTRL key and mouse pointer is hovering over a signal, you change only this signal's volt/div.

**Third way:** In the time axis of the scope, if you scroll the mouse wheel, you change the time/div. In the left axis of the scope, if you scroll the mouse wheel, you change the volt/div of the Channel-1. In the right axis of the scope, if you scroll the mouse wheel, you change the volt/div of the Channel-2 \(or another signal if it is hovered\).  ****
