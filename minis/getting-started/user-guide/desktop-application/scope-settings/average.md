# Average

In Minis, averaging technique is a function that takes the average of a specified number of waveforms. This is useful for removing noise from a repetitive signal. As a result of this process, you obtain a cleaner waveform with an increased vertical resolution without affecting the frequency resolution of the original waveforms.

You can specify the number of waveforms to be averaged by:

* Right clicking on the oscilloscope window.
* Opening the Preferences/Control Settings section.
{% endhint %}
