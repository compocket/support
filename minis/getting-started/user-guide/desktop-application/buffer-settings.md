# Buffer Settings

We try to make the software as flexiable as possible for the users. We try to give the control to the users as much as possible. Buffer settings can be an example for it.

When you right click on the **Buffer Navigator**, you see a popup. After clicking on it, Buffer Settings window opens.

**Buffer Depth:** You can change the buffer depth. \(Default: 4096\)  
**FPS Limit:** \(Default: 60\)  
**Real-time Update Rate:** This determines the number of samples that the device takes in one second. \(Default: 50\)  
**ADC Sampling Rate:** If auto is not selected, ADC sampling rate is fixed. If auto is selected, ADC sampling rate is  determined by the time/div. \(Default: Auto\)
