1. The color of the toolbar indicates the connection status. Green and red color corresponds to "connected" and "disconnected" respectively.
2. This button locks/unlocks the scope area. If it is locked, the application ignores all the touch events in the scope area.
3. This button shows a dialog in which you can select the trigger source \(CH1/CH2\), trigger mode\(Auto, Normal, Single\) and trigger edge\(Rising, Falling\). You can find other details in the [**Trigger** ](scope-settings/trigger.md)section.
4. Autoset button. The system tries to find the best volt/div and time/div values for better observation.
5. It toggles the visibility of the measurements\(Frequency, Period, PP, Max, Mean, Min, Rms, Duty Cycle\).
6. The buffer navigator shows the complete buffer. In addition, the signal that is visible in the graph is highlighted in the navigator. For other details about buffer, check [**Buffer Settings**](buffer-settings.md).
7. Reset the horizontal and vertical offsets in the graph.
8. It shows a dialog in which you can select the graph as Analog, Digital or XY. 
9. It shows a dialog in which you can control the visibility and AC/DC Coupling of the signals. Also you can create new signals from the existing one with math operations. 
10. Play/Pause button. It starts/stops the device. 
11. The scope area includes a graph that displays the signal values in the time domain. The graph shows both the time values and volt values for the channels. For other details about scope, check [**Scope Settings**](scope-settings/).
12. It gives information about the acquisition, sampling rate, buffer depth and ADC range.
13. This floating action button opens another set of control buttons.
