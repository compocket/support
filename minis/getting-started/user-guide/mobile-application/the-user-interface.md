1. The color of the toolbar indicates the connection status. Green and red color corresponds to "connected" and "disconnected" respectively.
2. This button locks/unlocks the oscilloscope area. If it is locked, the application ignores all the touch events in the oscilloscope area.
3. This button shows a dialog in which you can select the trigger source \(CH1/CH2\), trigger mode\(Auto, Normal, Single\) and trigger edge\(Rising, Falling\). You can find other details in the [**Trigger** ](scope-settings/trigger.md)section.
4. Autoset button. The system tries to find the best volt/div and time/div values for better observation.
5. It toggles the visibility of the measurements\(Frequency, Period, PP, Max, Mean, Min, Rms, Duty Cycle\).
6. The buffer navigator shows the complete buffer. In addition, the signal that is visible in the graph is highlighted in the navigator. For other details about buffer, check [**Buffer Settings**](buffer-settings.md).
7. It fits all the signals into the screen.
8. It shows a menu in which you can select the visibility of **Scope**, **XY** and **FFT** graphs. 
9. It shows a menu in which you can change some settings of the signals such as **name**, **gain**, **unit**, **color** and **AC/DC Coupling**. Also you can create new signals from the existing one with math operations. 
10. Play/Pause\(Run/Hold\) button. It starts/stops the device. 
11. The oscilloscope area includes a graph that displays the signal values in the time domain. The graph shows both the time values and volt values for the channels. For other details about oscilloscope, check [**Oscilloscope Settings**](scope-settings/).
12. It gives information about the acquisition, sampling rate, buffer depth.
13. This floating action button opens another set of control buttons. You can share the screenshot of the graph, follow the tutorial or [**update** ](firmware-update.md)your device's firmware. Also you can send a feedback to us!
