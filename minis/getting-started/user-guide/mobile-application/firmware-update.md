# Firmware Update

Once you click on the firmware update section in the settings menu, a screen opens up where you can see the latest firmware version and your Minis' version, if you have plugged one.

To update the firmware of your Minis, you just need to click on the download button of the firmware you desire to update to. The update process consists of three stages: downloading the firmware from our servers, programming the firmware into your Minis and the verification of the firmware. The green check mark indicates that the relevant process is completed successfully. If there is no problem \(i.e. communication failures or network problems\) the update process should take only a couple of seconds.
