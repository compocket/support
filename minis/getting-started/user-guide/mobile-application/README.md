# Mobile Application

The mobile application and desktop application have some similarities and differences in terms of user interface and features. Due to the screen sizes of the mobile phones, we changed the UI and some functionalities on the mobile application. 

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not have Advanced Functions, Dockable & Floating Layouts in Android application unlike to Desktop application. We do not plan to add them for now.
{% endhint %}
